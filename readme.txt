It includes the following sections:

Purpose:  
--------  
The main goal of this website is to:  
- Present my background and technical skills  
- Highlight projects I have worked on  
- Provide a professional way for potential employers, clients, or collaborators to contact me  

Technologies Used:  
------------------  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with animations and transitions)  
- JavaScript (for interactivity)  
- Responsive Design (Flexbox / Media Queries)  

How to Run Locally:  
--------------------  
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. No build tools or servers are required â€” it runs purely on the frontend  

Customization:  
--------------  
- To change content, edit the HTML files in the root directory  
- For styling, modify the CSS files inside the `css/` folder
